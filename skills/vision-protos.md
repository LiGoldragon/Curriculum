description: Protos — the shared parsing style, its layers, delimiters, multi-pass engine or canonical print — is being designed or judged against what the living wants.

## What Protos is

Protos is the name for the style all the dialects share. The
context-switching parse, the delimiters, the heads, the recursive
structure — this is the code that can be shared between all parsers
and belongs in protos. Datom is a protos dialect, carrying only
pure typed data; it does not take part in the multi-pass
rust-generation engine that ethos, nomos and logos are slated to
become, but it shares the protos style. The final fully-decomposed
engine with three daemons is the protos engine.

## What Protos knows

Protos is only about structure. It has nothing to do with struct and
vector, and it only understands form: the syntactic structure. It
would not know what anything is. A head in protos is just a head —
anatomy, not interpretation. Pure anatomy is only structural
recognition of structures, nothing more. Protos examples show the
textual structure — the delimiters, the head, the capitalization, the
recursive structure — universally, at a very high level,
non-dialect-specific.

## Layers

Four layers, text above and the value below: the textual layer; the
protosic layer, whose root type is the `Protos` enum; the conceptual
layer, which is the datomic, ethosic, logosic, or nomosic layer
according to the language; and the compositional layer, the
composition, the value put together in memory, the densest form.
Going down, the information gains density and strictness; going up,
visibility. Each step converts into a wholly different type, and
nothing of the previous step is used after it.

```
; textual: these characters, uninterpreted
{ Ada 1990 }
```
```rust
// protosic: an enclosure of two bare runs, each structure at its extent in the text
Protos::Enclosed(Braced, vec![Protos::Bare("Ada"), Protos::Bare("1990")])
// conceptual, here datomic: a struct of two positions, each datom at its path
Datom { path: [], form: Form::Struct(vec![Datom { path: [0], form: Form::Bare("Ada") }, Datom { path: [1], form: Form::Bare("1990") }]) }
// compositional: the meaning fully absorbed; no position, because the tree is consumed
Person { name: String::from("Ada"), born: 1990 }
```

## Every layer carries its own context

A value at a layer contains the context it makes sense in, in both
directions, and no layer carries a fact that belongs to another. The
extent, where a structure sits in the text, is a fact of the protosic
layer, and every `Protos` node carries one. The path, where a datom
sits in its tree, is a fact of the datomic layer, and every datom
carries one, read down from text or built up from a composition
alike. The budget, how much reading one act allows, is a fact of the
reader and lives on it. The composition carries no position: it is
the layer where context has been consumed. There is no site and no
situated pair; an error's locus is the datom's path, and its extent
is found by following that path into the protos the reader holds.

## Kinds are borne by the type converted and named for the layer it becomes

No type bears a kind two layers away. A chain is written in the open
where it is used, never folded into a kind on its first type.

| type | kind | becomes |
|---|---|---|
| text | `Protosizable` | protos |
| `Protos` | `Textualizable` | text |
| `Protos` | `Datomizable`, or `Ethosizable` further on | its concept |
| `Datom` | `Protosizable` | protos |
| `Datom` | `Composable` | any compositional type |
| composition | `Datomizable` | datom |
| composition | `Compositional` | states its own positions, so a datom can compose it |

```rust
impl Protosizable  for String { fn protosize(&self) -> Result<Protos, Error>; }
impl Textualizable for Protos { fn textualize(&self) -> String; }
impl Datomizable   for Protos { fn datomize(&self) -> Result<Datom, Error>; }
impl Protosizable  for Datom  { fn protosize(&self) -> Protos; }
impl Composable    for Datom  { fn compose<T: Compositional>(&self, budget: &mut Budget) -> Result<T, Error>; }
impl Datomizable   for Person { fn datomize(&self, at: Path) -> Datom; }
impl Compositional for Person { const ARITY: Integer; fn from_positions(p: Positions<'_>) -> Result<Self, Error>; }

let text = person.datomize(Path::root()).protosize().textualize();
```

## Signal is parallel

Signal is not a layer of the chain: a parallel structure exchanging
compositions in one step, an rkyv serialization carrying our own
protocol.

## Delimiters

Five pairs. `{ }`, `[ ]`, `< >` structural; `« »` opaque, every glyph
content; `( )` reserved for meaning, its type unspecified, read by
balance as opaque until it is. The curly quotes are not delimiters.
Every structure of the protosic layer is a variant of the `Protos`
enum, and none of them means anything on its own: whether an
enclosure is a struct or a vector, whether a bare run is a name or a
number, is said by the conceptual layer that reads it.

```rust
Protos::Enclosed(Braced, vec![Protos::Bare("Ada"), Protos::Bare("1990")])   // structure: an enclosure of two runs
Datom::Struct(vec![Datom::Bare("Ada"), Datom::Bare("1990")])                // meaning: a struct of two positions
```

## Structure

Structure is the word for every unit of the text; its type is the
`Protos` enum: headed, enclosed, opaque, or bare.

A headed structure is a head, a separator and a body. The separators
are period, exclamation and colon. The head is a symbol. The body is
another structure. Heads may be daisy-chained: different separators
too.

An enclosed structure stands between its delimiters; a bare structure
has no delimiters. A brace-enclosed structure's arity is anatomical;
a bracket-enclosed structure's arity is not. Angle brackets are a
real protos delimiter. The key-value map, which the guillemets once
delimited, is dropped entirely from protos and its dialects.

## String, escape, error

The text type is `String`. A closing guillemet inside a string is
escaped with a backslash, so the ascent never refuses. The word is
error, not fault, through the chain.

```
«she said \»no\» and left»
```

## Multi-pass

Multiple passes are wanted over a single pass, because a single pass
creates corner-cutting bad design. The multiple steps create a mental
model of the machinery, which enforces a correctness in the code that
is millions of times more beneficial than the cost of doing these
multiple passes.

## Canonical print

It is canonical, and it is considered good style, to leave a space
between the delimiters and the content, except inside the guillemets,
where every glyph is content and a space would be load-bearing. Space
the delimiters and the inner content.
