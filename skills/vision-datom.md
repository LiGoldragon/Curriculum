description: Datom — its syntax, strings, containers, errors, codec or relation to Ethos — is being designed or judged against what the living wants it to be.
dependencies: [datom, vision-ethos]

## Name

Datom is the psyche’s own coinage for the new data notation, the
successor to NOTA and to the rejected name Dotos. The name was
chosen for its energetic power and to echo what the notation is:
data, strictly typed, super dense, no field names. The library is
datom-codec. Datomic names the conceptual layer abstractly; it is
not a term of the code.

## Nature

Datom is the most advanced textual data format in the world. It
carries data, strictly typed, and its whole work is serialization and
deserialization: carrying data between text and typed form. Datom is
signal's form at the edge: our components speak signal, and datom lets
text-based systems, LLMs and every existing editor, read and write it.
Generating Rust is Ethos's duty, in today's division of labor. When
Ethos becomes the full authoring language, with Rustlang as its
assembly layer, Datom, the data dialect of the Protos family, may gain
an inline place in authored Ethos, the way Rustlang composes data
directly in code. That road is reached, or even floated, only with
explicit context: how, when, and where data yields Rust, stated
without ambiguity; until then the division stands as spoken.

## A datom is a form at a path

```rust
pub struct Datom { pub path: Path, pub form: Form }
pub enum Form { Struct(Vec<Datom>), Vector(Vec<Datom>), Variant(Symbol, Box<Datom>), Bare(String), String(String), Meaning(Opaque) }
```

## Strings

Two string forms. The bare form, whose name is bare: a run with no
space and no delimiter glyph, which may be a whole sentence written
without spaces in any casing; "word" does not do it justice. It is a
bare string, undelimited because it needs no delimiters. The delimited
form: guillemets, which keep the doubleness of the double quote,
cannot be mistyped for it, and point, so the ends are visible at any
size.

```
Ada     TheBuildPassedOnTheThirdTry     «12 Rue de la Paix»
```

## Syntax

Structure is the word for every unit of the text: enclosed when it
stands between its delimiters, unenclosed when bare. A headed
structure is a head, a separator and a body; the dot is the separator,
written right after the head, and it opens the body's delimiter. A
head is a symbol. In datom a head is always a variant, so it is
capitalized. Which head a structure carries is part of its type:
`Accepted.{ … }` and `Refused.{ … }` are two types. When an enum value
is textualized, its variant's name is written as the head every time,
a variant carrying nothing included: `Pending`, never an empty
structure. A brace structure is a struct and a bracket structure is a
vector. A head in front of a structure makes a variant that carries
it: `Reviewer.{ 2024 17 }` is the Reviewer variant carrying a struct
of two positions, and `Observed.Locks.[]` is the Observed variant
carrying the Locks variant carrying an empty vector. A symbol alone,
in a position expecting an enum, is a variant carrying nothing. A
datom is not preceded by a Datom root; a comment may say it is datom.
Guillemets are the string delimiter, and parentheses are reserved for
Meaning. A string is a string only in a position where the type
defines a string. In such a position a string is written bare when it
contains no space and no delimiter, Ada, 75002, 2026-09-03; any other
string is written in guillemets. Because the position already knows it
holds a string, a bare run may contain characters that are syntax
elsewhere, the colon among them. A guillemet string is opaque: every
glyph inside it is content until the closing guillemet, which is
escaped with a backslash where it is content. An integer is written as
bare decimal, 0, 42, -42: ASCII digits, no leading plus, no leading
zero except 0 itself. A single semicolon opens a comment. Canonical
text leaves a space inside every bracket and brace delimiter, at both
ends, so that head, dot, delimiter and content read apart, and never
inside the guillemets, where a space is content.

```
; datom, in a position expecting Person: a struct of name String, born Integer, address Address, roles Vector<Role>.
; Each comment names the structure that starts on its line. Indentation shows which structure holds which.
{                                        ; the whole Person is one structure, enclosed by braces: a struct. It holds four structures.
  Ada                                    ;   unenclosed, a bare run. The position says String, so it is a string.
  1990                                   ;   unenclosed. The position says Integer.
  { «12 Rue de la Paix» Paris 75002 }    ;   enclosed by braces: a struct, the Address. It holds three structures:
                                         ;     one enclosed by guillemets, opaque, and two unenclosed.
  [ Author                               ;   enclosed by brackets: a vector of Role. It holds two structures:
    Reviewer.{ 2024 17 } ]               ;     a symbol alone, the Author variant carrying nothing, and a headed structure:
}                                        ;     head Reviewer, the dot, and a body that is itself a struct of two unenclosed structures.
                                         ; The closing brace ends the outermost structure, the Person itself.
```

The whole is a structure, and so is every part of it, down to the
unenclosed ones, which hold nothing. What a structure means, struct,
vector, string, integer, variant, is said by the position it sits in,
never by the structure alone.

```
; Reply: an enum of Accepted.{ id Integer  at String }, Refused.{ reason String  code Integer }, Pending
Accepted.{ 42 2026-09-03T17:46:20 }          ; the timestamp has no space and no delimiter, so it is bare
Refused.{ «no such file: { } is content» 2 } ; delimited: the string has spaces and braces; inside the guillemets they are content
Pending                                      ; a variant carrying nothing

; a vector of Integer
[ 0 42 -42 ]
```

## The datom composes; the type states its positions

The descent into a composition is the datom's act, written once. What
only the type can supply, its positions in order, is stated by the
type through the derive, so the reading of the tree, arity, budget,
locus, lives in one place and no type repeats it.

```rust
impl Composable for Datom {
    fn compose<T: Compositional>(&self, budget: &mut Budget) -> Result<T, Error> {
        let positions = self.positions(T::ARITY, budget)?;   // this form, as a struct of that arity, else an error at this path
        T::from_positions(positions)
    }
}
```

## Any Rust type

Datom is used on more than ethos-declared types. Any Rust type bears
the two kinds through a derive in datom-codec, with no attributes,
because datom is structural all the way down: field order is position
order, a field's type is the position's type, a bare variant carries
nothing, a single-field variant carries its type's own form, a
multi-field variant carries an inline struct. Hand-written impls are
reserved to the intrinsics.

```rust
#[derive(Datomizable, Compositional)]
pub struct Locus { pub path: Path, pub extent: Extent }

impl Compositional for Locus {                              // generated
    const ARITY: Integer = 2;
    fn from_positions(mut p: Positions<'_>) -> Result<Self, Error> { Ok(Locus { path: p.position()?, extent: p.position()? }) }
}
impl Datomizable for Locus {                                // generated: each child placed as the tree is built
    fn datomize(&self, at: Path) -> Datom {
        Datom { form: Form::Struct(vec![self.path.datomize(at.child(0)), self.extent.datomize(at.child(1))]), path: at }
    }
}
```

## From text and back

A potential, text that may become a T, owns the budget and actualizes
by the descent written once: protosize, datomize, compose. A
composition becomes text by the open chain.

```rust
let query: Query = Potential::<Query>::from(text).actualize(budget)?;
let out = response.datomize(Path::root()).protosize().textualize();
```

## Containers

Vector, Option, Result, Box bear the kinds once, generically; Option
and Result read as ordinary variants.

```
[ Some.42 None ]     Ok.{ Ada 1990 }     Err.«no such lock»
```

## Errors

An error names the layer that raised it and the path of the datom
where it arose; the extent is the protos node at that path. An error
is itself datomizable.

```
[ 1 x ]                                  ; read as Vector<Integer>
Corporate.{ [ 1 ] Value.x }              ; at path 1, the bare string x is not an integer
```

## Omittable fields

Not yet; a written datom gives every position.

```
Deploy.{ ouranos }     ; Arity.{ 2 1 }
```

## The interface shape

A program's configuration surface is the datom's shape itself, as the
ethos interface declares it: a data enum at the root whose variants
are the main operations. A variant's data carries what follows:
another enum where sub-operations are wanted, a struct or vector for
final options, and a struct may embed further sub-operations, or any
combination imaginable. Output is an enum, always; even the most basic
response interface is an enum: Success or Failure. The shape already
is the interface: datom creates the configuration options by its very
shape, and a CLI takes its whole configuration from its datom input. A
Nexus reply is written as its heads down to its data, and only what
carries data is written: an empty Locks observation is
Observed.Locks.[], the Observed variant, its Locks variant, the empty
vector; the layout of a nonempty payload is open.

```
; datom, each in a position expecting the response enum named in the comment
Observed.Locks.[]    ; orchestrate's response: the Observed variant, its Locks variant, the empty vector
Success              ; the most basic response: a variant carrying nothing
```

## De/serialization

Schema-driven and positional: the reader walks the expected type,
writing is the exact reverse projection, and decoding lands directly
in the typed Rust compositions. A datom on the way in is a potential
datom, untrusted until it matches its type; on the way out it is a
datom. All naming and self-description live in the type; the text
carries only the data.

```
; datom, in a position expecting Scores: a struct of name String, values Vector<Integer>.
; The reader walks the type: first position a string, second a vector of integers. The text carries only the data.
{ Ada [ 12 7 -3 ] }
```

## Relation to Ethos

Datom and Ethos are different languages that share an approach, not a
parser. What they may share is a substrate, kinds with a shared
implementation and types; the universal substrate machinery is homed
in protos, all dialects ride it, and datom is the pure-data dialect on
it. Ethos could come to depend on Datom for another reason: ethos
might be read as datom in one pass. Whether that is even possible,
given the situation and the actualization involved in parsing ethos,
is not settled, and the question is set aside for now.

## Repository

Everything moves to Datom: all of the stack, Horizon, Lojix, everything;
no Dotos file remains. Datom's own line of descent is NOTA, which also
passed through the temporary name Dotos; that old notation stays
behind, frozen, and may be called legacy. Schema is the abandoned
ancestor of Ethos, not of Datom. The library is named datom-codec so
that datom is free for the datom nexus, which comes when there is more
to do: translating datom objects between formats, and a parsing cache
keyed by the content-addressed hash of normalized text.

## Map

A map is a container whose keys are known only from the data: the
reader learns the shape by reading, where a struct's shape is known
before reading. Datom is typed from the position down: a position
knows its type before the text is read, and a container that reveals
its shape only in the text contradicts that. So datom has no map. Most
of what is called a map is not one: an object with fixed fields, a
configuration table, a record written as a dictionary. These are
structs whose notation declined to declare their fields, and every
such notation ends up adding a way to declare them; that the word
covers so much that is not a map shows how little a map is actually
used. The map that remains, its keys minted at run time and its values
all of one type, is a vector of structs, which is how the typed data
formats already write it; that keys do not repeat is a rule the type
states. What a map would hold is a struct when its keys are fixed, and
a vector of structs when they are not. Datom does not implement a
thing because it has been standard in the past.

## Meaning

Meaning is the structured string: text that carries, besides its
words, the emphasis and the other structural aspects a plain string
simply lacks, an annotated string, meant to revolutionize the
performance of thinking machines on text. The aim is the most
advanced structured meaning system ever made. Parentheses are a
major symbol of cognition, and in datom they have one duty: the
parenthesis pair is the Meaning delimiter, as the guillemets are
the plain string's. The seed of the design is that parentheses
inside ordinary text are already markup, so a Meaning is read by
balance: a parenthesis pair inside it is structure of its own,
nesting to arbitrary depth, a graph of sorts, and the Meaning closes
at the parenthesis that balances the one that opened it; an
unbalanced parenthesis inside it is escaped. Opening a Meaning makes
the whole delimiter and structure spectrum available inside it,
until the closing parenthesis restores the outer context. Its
annotations are enums used throughout the tree, Emphasis among them;
its shape is still open. Meaning is datom. Strings are strings and
Meaning is Meaning: a position of type String expects a plain string
and nothing else, and a position of type Meaning expects a Meaning.
Meaning is postponed so that a working syntax lands as soon as
possible: today a parenthesized text lands as a plain String, with
the later type marked in code. The name Meaning smells of a verb; it
stands provisionally and is reopened together with the type.

```
; datom, in a position expecting Note: a struct of author String, body Meaning.
; The first position expects a string: Ada has no space and no delimiter, so it is bare.
; The second position expects a Meaning, so the parenthesis opens it and it is read by balance:
; the inner pair is structure inside the Meaning, and the parenthesis that balances the opening one ends it.
; Today the whole parenthesized text lands as a plain String; what the inner pair will mean is not yet designed.
{ Ada (The build passed on the third try (after two timeouts)) }

; datom, in a position expecting Remark: a struct of author String, body String.
; The second position expects a plain string; it has spaces, so it is delimited,
; and the parentheses inside the guillemets are content, not a Meaning.
{ Ada «The build passed on the third try (after two timeouts)» }

; datom, in a position expecting Standup: a struct of team String, items Vector<Meaning>.
; Each component of the vector is one Meaning; each is read by balance on its own.
{ Backend
  [ (Ada fixed the flaky test (the one with the timeout))
    (Bo is out (back Monday)) ] }
```

The meaning language is now developed, and is defined in
Vision/meaning.md; that supersedes the postponement stated above.
